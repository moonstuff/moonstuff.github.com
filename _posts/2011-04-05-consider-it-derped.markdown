title: Consider it derped
---

I've just finished derping the data set. Now everything is fully anonymized and ready for aggregation. It certainly is big enough, 1.6 billion records and 265GB of data.

    $ zcat events-derped.gz |pv |wc -l
     265GB 0:33:00 [ 137MB/s]
     1638525289

Should be lots of fun.
